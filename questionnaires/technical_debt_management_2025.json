  "context": "A psychometric inventory designed for software engineers working in the fast-paced development environments of 2025. This survey investigates how developers navigate the perpetual tension between delivering new features rapidly ('shipping') and maintaining long-term code health. It assesses individual philosophies on code quality, willingness to tolerate 'spaghetti code' for short-term gains, and preferences regarding when (or if) to pay down accumulated technical debt.",
