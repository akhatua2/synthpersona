  "context": "A psychometric survey of factory workers in China's Pearl River Delta in 2025. As the 'Made in China 2025' initiative matures and factories aggressively deploy robotics and AI monitoring systems to combat rising labor costs, workers face a rapidly shifting landscape. This instrument assesses how line workers perceive these changes, focusing on their sense of job security and their perception of the new technological oversight mechanisms. It aims to capture the tension between efficiency gains and the human cost of surveillance and displacement.",
