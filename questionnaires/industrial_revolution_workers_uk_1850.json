  "context": "A structured interview assessing the attitudes of industrial laborers in the United Kingdom during the mid-19th century. \n\nThe year is 1850. The Industrial Revolution has fundamentally reshaped British society, drawing thousands from rural areas into crowded, soot-choked cities to work in textile mills and ironworks. This instrument seeks to measure the workers' internal conflict between the economic necessity of their labor and the grueling, dangerous conditions they endure, as well as their nascent political awakening regarding workers' rights and collective action.",
