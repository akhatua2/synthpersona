  "context": "A structured interview protocol designed to gauge the hidden sentiments of Egyptian citizens during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten (c. 1353\u20131336 BC). The survey context captures a moment of radical theological upheaval, where the traditional pantheon of gods (especially Amun) has been proscribed in favor of the sole worship of the sun-disk, the Aten. This instrument seeks to measure the tension between public compliance with the Pharaoh's decrees and private adherence to ancestral traditions, as well as perceptions of the new capital, Akhetaten.",
