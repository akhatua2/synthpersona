Amidst the proliferation of fallout shelters, 'Duck and Cover' drills, and the looming Cuban Missile Crisis, this instrument assesses the pervasive dread of nuclear annihilation and the degree of trust placed in government containment strategies. It aims to quantify the psychological toll of living under the constant threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.",
