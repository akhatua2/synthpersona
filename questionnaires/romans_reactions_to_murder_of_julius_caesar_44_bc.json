  "context": "A structured opinion survey capturing the immediate political sentiment of Roman citizens in the days following the Ides of March, 44 BC. This instrument is designed to measure the polarization of the populace between those who view the assassination as a necessary act of liberation against tyranny and those who view it as a destabilizing betrayal of a populist hero. It probes deeper sociopolitical attitudes regarding the trade-off between republican liberty and authoritarian stability, as well as the respondent's emotional response to the potential for renewed civil war.",
