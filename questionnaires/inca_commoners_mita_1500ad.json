  "context": "A psychometric evaluation of the attitudes and experiences of 'Hatun Runa' (commoners) within the Inca Empire regarding the mita labor tax system around 1500 AD. The instrument explores the delicate balance between civic duty to the Sapa Inca and the personal hardships of mandatory labor rotations in agriculture, infrastructure, or military service. It aims to capture the degree to which individuals view this obligation as a sacred reciprocal exchange (ayni) versus an oppressive burden imposed by the state.",
