  "context": "A structured survey designed to capture the attitudes of professional athletes competing in major European leagues regarding gender equity initiatives as of 2025. Following several years of aggressive policy changes by governing bodies (e.g., FIFA, FIBA, UEFA) aimed at closing the pay gap and increasing media visibility for women's sports, this instrument assesses whether athletes perceive these changes as sufficient, excessive, or well-balanced. It specifically targets the tension between traditional meritocratic revenue arguments and progressive equity mandates within the locker room culture.",
