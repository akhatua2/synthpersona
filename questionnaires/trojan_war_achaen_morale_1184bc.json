  "context": "A psychometric evaluation of Achaean troop morale during the protracted siege of Troy, circa 1184 BC. This instrument is designed to assess the psychological state of the rank-and-file soldiery after nine years of stalemate, plague, and internecine leadership disputes (e.g., between Achilles and Agamemnon). It explores their motivation to continue fighting, their trust in divine favor and leadership, and their overwhelming desire for 'nostos' (homecoming) versus the pursuit of 'kleos' (glory).",
