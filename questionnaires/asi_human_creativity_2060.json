  "context": "A psychometric study of human self-worth in a post-scarcity creative economy.\n\nIn the year 2060, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) creates art, literature, and music that is objectively indistinguishable from, or superior to, human masterpieces. While basic needs are met, humans struggle to define the value of their own creative output in a world where AI can produce infinite, personalized variations of any concept instantly. This instrument measures how individuals navigate the crisis of meaning, assessing whether they view human-made art as possessing a unique 'soul' or if they have embraced a collaborative, cyborgian definition of creativity.",
