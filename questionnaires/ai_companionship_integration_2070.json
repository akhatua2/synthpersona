  "context": "A sociological survey designed to measure societal acceptance of artificial entities as primary social partners in the late 21st century. By 2070, humanoid androids and virtual avatars are indistinguishable from humans in conversation and affect, leading to a widespread phenomenon where AI entities serve as spouses, best friends, and caregivers. This instrument investigates the deep-seated cultural divide between those who view these relationships as genuine, fulfilling connections and those who view them as a dangerous erosion of authentic human intimacy.",
