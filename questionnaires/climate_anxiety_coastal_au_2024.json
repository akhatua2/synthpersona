  "context": "A psychometric assessment of climate-related distress in coastal Australian communities.\n\nSet in 2024, following a series of extreme weather events (bushfires, floods, and bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef), this instrument targets residents of Australia's coastal regions. It measures the psychological burden of living on the frontlines of climate change, distinguishing between generalized worry about the future and specific, localized fear of property loss or displacement. The survey aims to quantify the emotional toll of environmental instability on a population historically defined by their relationship with the ocean.",
