  "context": "A psychometric survey of the Parisian artistic community in 2026, two years after the widespread adoption of advanced generative AI models. As traditional artistic hubs like Montmartre and Le Marais grapple with the digitization of aesthetics, this instrument assesses the tension between human craftsmanship and algorithmic output. It explores how working artists perceive the ontological status of AI-generated works and their fears or hopes regarding the economic viability of human-made art.",
