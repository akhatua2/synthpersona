  "context": "A sociological survey conducted in 2023 among semi-nomadic herders in Mongolia. As climate change (dzud) and urbanization put pressure on traditional lifestyles, this instrument investigates how herders balance their ancestral connection to the steppe with the allure and necessity of modern conveniences and city life. It specifically targets heads of households living in gers who migrate seasonally but have access to mobile technology and vehicles.",
