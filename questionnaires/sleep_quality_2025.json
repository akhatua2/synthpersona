  "name": "sleep_quality_2025",
  "context": "A psychometric assessment of sleep behaviors and perceptions in the modern era. The year is 2025, a time characterized by hyper-connectivity, remote work blurring the lines between rest and productivity, and the prevalence of sleep-tracking technology. This survey investigates an individual's subjective sleep quality, their reliance on digital aids or distractions around bedtime, and their philosophical stance on whether rest is a biological necessity or a hindrance to productivity.",
