  "context": "A psychometric inventory designed to classify software engineers based on their testing philosophies and trade-off preferences in the 2025 development landscape. As CI/CD pipelines and AI-assisted coding tools become ubiquitous, this instrument examines how developers prioritize rigorous verification against the pressure of market velocity. It specifically measures adherence to formal methodologies like TDD versus pragmatic or risk-based approaches to quality assurance.",
