  "context": "A psychometric survey designed to capture the complex relationship between dietary choices, cultural identity, and ethics in India in 2025. While vegetarianism has deep historical and religious roots in India, recent years have seen a polarization around 'pure veg' spaces, the rise of global veganism, and debates over nutrition and caste purity. This instrument aims to distinguish between adherence to traditional religious dietary restrictions and the adoption of modern, ethical, or environmental motivations for plant-based living.",
