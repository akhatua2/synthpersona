  "context": "A psychometric inventory designed to evaluate the trade-offs and priorities software engineers manage during the code review process in 2024. Amidst the pressure for rapid feature delivery and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), this instrument assesses how engineers balance the need for rigorous quality assurance against the demand for development velocity. It also explores their underlying philosophy regarding technical debt and whether they view code reviews primarily as a gatekeeping mechanism or a collaborative mentorship opportunity.",
