  "context": "A psychometric instrument to assess public sentiment regarding ubiquitous health monitoring technology.\n\nThe year is 2030. Advanced biometric wearables have become cheap and ubiquitous, offering real-time tracking of everything from cortisol levels to early cancer markers, often shared directly with insurers and employers for 'perks.' This survey investigates individual comfort levels with this new era of radical transparency, specifically focusing on the tension between health optimization and personal privacy.",
