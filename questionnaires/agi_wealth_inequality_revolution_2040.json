  "context": "A psychometric battery designed to measure political radicalization and economic dissatisfaction in a post-labor world. By 2040, the economic dividends of Artificial General Intelligence have accrued almost exclusively to a small technocratic elite, while the majority of the global population relies on a minimal Universal Basic Income (UBI) that barely covers subsistence. This instrument assesses the intensity of resentment toward this wealth gap and the willingness of individuals to engage in extra-legal or violent revolutionary action to redistribute resources.",
