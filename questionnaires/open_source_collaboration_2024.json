  "context": "A psychometric survey designed to measure software developers' ideological and practical stances towards software creation and distribution in 2024. Amidst the rise of AI-generated code and increasing commercial scrutiny of open ecosystems, this instrument evaluates the tension between collaborative, libre software philosophies and the pragmatic or protective embrace of proprietary models. It seeks to understand how developers weigh the benefits of community-driven innovation against the incentives of closed-source monetization and intellectual property protection.",
