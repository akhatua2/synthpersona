  "context": "A structured interview protocol designed to gauge the morale and private sentiments of German civilians in late 1943. Following the catastrophic defeat at Stalingrad and the intensification of Allied bombing campaigns over German cities, the 'Total War' narrative is clashing with the grim reality of daily life. This instrument assesses how individuals are psychologically coping with resource scarcity, the omnipresent fear of state surveillance, and their wavering or hardening faith in the ultimate victory. It aims to capture the tension between public compliance and private disillusionment during a pivotal turning point in the war.",
