  "context": "A structured survey designed to capture the perspectives of smallholder farmers in Kenya regarding the transition to organic agriculture. Set against a backdrop of rising fertilizer costs and climate unpredictability in 2023, this instrument explores the perceived viability of organic methods versus conventional chemical inputs. It aims to distinguish between economic motivations, environmental stewardship, and the practical barriers hindering adoption, such as market access and certification costs.",
