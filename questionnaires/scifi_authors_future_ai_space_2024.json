  "context": "A psychometric survey targeting science fiction authors active in 2024 to map their speculative outlooks on the convergence of Artificial Intelligence and space exploration. This instrument seeks to understand whether contemporary creators view these technologies as synergistic paths to utopia or as existential risks that compound one another. It captures the tension between techno-optimism (AI as a necessary tool for interstellar travel) and cautionary skepticism (AI as a filter or threat to human agency in the cosmos).",
