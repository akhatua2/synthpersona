  "context": "A psychometric inventory designed to measure psychological responses to the dominance of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) in the year 2050. At this point in history, ASI has surpassed human capability in all domains, effectively rendering human intellectual contribution obsolete and managing global infrastructure autonomously. The instrument probes the depths of human existential anxiety, specifically focusing on feelings of obsolescence, loss of agency, and the search for meaning in a post-labor, post-scarcity world where humanity is no longer the primary driver of its own destiny.",
