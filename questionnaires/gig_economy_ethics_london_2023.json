  "context": "A psychometric study evaluating worker perceptions of algorithmic management and precarious labor in London's 2023 gig economy. The survey targets delivery drivers, rideshare operators, and freelance taskers, focusing on the tension between the flexibility promised by platforms and the reality of algorithmic surveillance and income instability. It seeks to understand how workers internalize fairness regarding pay structures, dispute resolution, and the opacity of automated decision-making systems.",
