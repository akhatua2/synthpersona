  "context": "A psychometric survey evaluating public sentiment regarding Universal Basic Income (UBI) proposals in California. Set in 2026, amid rising automation, housing costs, and income inequality, the state legislature is debating a permanent statewide dividend funded by tech sector taxation. This instrument is designed to measure how citizens weigh the economic security provided by UBI against concerns about work ethic, government dependency, and fiscal feasibility. It targets a diverse demographic across the state to capture ideological and pragmatic splits on wealth redistribution.",
